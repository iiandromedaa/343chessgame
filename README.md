# Assignment Introduction

A Software Design Document (SDD) describes the design and architecture of your software. This type of documentation often follows the 4+1 design perspectives approach. The 4 perspectives (or views) of software are

1. *Logical View* – major components, their attributes and operations. This view also includes relationships between components and their interactions. When doing OO design, class diagrams and sequence diagrams are often used to express the logical view.
2. *Process View* – the threads of control and processes used to execute the operations identified in the logical view.
3. *Development View* – how system modules map to development organization.
4. *Physical View* – shows the system hardware and how software components are distributed across the processors in the system.  

The +1 perspective is the 

> Use Case View – the use case view is used to both motivate and validate design activity. At the start of design the requirements define the functional objectives for the design. Use cases are also used to validate suggested designs. It should be possible to walk through a use case scenario and follow the interaction between high-level components. The components should have all the necessary behavior to conceptually execute a use case.

# Assignment Requirements
 
For your project, you are only required to document the ***Logical View*** of your software, You must use markdown (.md file) to do this. 

Your documentation should have three sections: Overview, Design, Examples, and Status. Requirements for each section are described below.

# Overview of Required Sections

## Overview

Give a high-level description of your software. The description should be clear and professional. You can use images if it helps. 

## Design

The logical view describes the main functional components of the system. This includes modules and the static relationships between modules.

### Diagrams you might want to use

- **Box and Line Diagram**: for depicting software components and how they are connected 
- **UML Class Diagram**: for depicting code structure
- **UML State Diagram**: for depicting states of your software
- **ERD Diagram**: for depicting the tables in a database

You can use any other diagram that you find helpful for describing your software. You are expected to use diagrams and clearly describe what is depicted in your diagrams. 

This section will contain the most content. The documentation should fully document the latest version of your software. If you make changes to your software, you should update this document to reflect those changes. 

## Examples

Give screenshots of your running project and briefly describe what is in the screenshots.

## Status

Give the current status of the software. List what is working and what is planned for future releases. When listing planned features, assume that the the project will continue even after the course ends.
